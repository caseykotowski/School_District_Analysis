# School_District_Analysis

## Purpose
A school district wanted to analyze the data from recent math and reading tests across all high schools in the district to determine budget allocation for the next year. The high schools are grade 9-12, and there is a mix of charter and standard district schools. I had access to data per student (test grades and school grade), as well as per school (size, budget, and type). 

It was my job to take this information and organize it, as well as take some calculations to show the district office how the schools are performing by grade, budget per student, size, and school type. 

There was a small issue, and there were reasons to suspect that the 9th grade class at Thomas high school had some manipulated grades in the system. This was discovered after the full analysis was completed, so I had to go back and remove all of that grade's data just to make sure the cheating did not affect the district's decisions. Due to these changes, a large part of the results will focus on how removing that school's 9th graders changes the overall performance of the school and how it stacks up to the rest of the district.
